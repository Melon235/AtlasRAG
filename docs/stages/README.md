# Stage workflow

AtlasRAG is implemented as a sequence of explicitly scoped stages. Each stage:

1. starts from the repository's default branch on a dedicated `stage/*` branch;
2. follows the Architecture Manual and changes only its declared scope;
3. adds tests and an evidence-bearing stage report;
4. runs the stable repository verification gate;
5. is committed and published without force-pushing; and
6. is reviewed independently before any merge into the default branch.

Local implementation does not make a stage complete. Completion additionally
requires its report, commit, successful GitHub publication, and—when available—a
green remote CI result.
